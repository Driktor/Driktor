- 👋 Hi, I’m @driktor
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something interesting.
- 📫 I am still thinking the best way on how to reach me.



- I have already programmed on these languages:
  - **BASIC** - _Yes, I am not a young boy..._
  - **HTML** - _Not a programming language, I know!_
  - **Pascal** - _Believe me, it was at my Engineering undergraduate program._
  - **C** - _For curiosity..._
  - **Visual Basic** - _To enhance some Excel spreadsheets at work._
  - **Python** - _To enter the Data Science world!_
